							<p>My philosophy as an educator is informed by my background as a first generation and international college student. I was privileged to have access to incredible learning opportunities, so I build communities where learning is made as accessible and engaging as possible.</p>
							<p>
							I’ve taught across a wide range of contexts: at large public research institutions and at small liberal arts colleges, in the humanities and in the social sciences, in-person, hybrid, and online. I’ve taught classes solo and in teams of ten colleagues. I’ve used all sorts of methods to build deep connections between learners and challenging subject matters.</p>

							<h3 class="major">Understanding Reading practices</h3>
									<b>CONTEXT</b>
									<p>In the spring of 2021, I designed a brand new English class for Washington and Lee's <a href="https://www.wlu.edu/academics/opportunities/experiential-learning/spring-term/">experiential 4-week spring term</a> with the following parameters in mind:</p>
									<ul>
									<li>The class would meet 3x a week for 3 hours per session (9 hours/week)</li>
									<li>Some of my students were on campus and others would join us remotely from their homes around the country.</li>
									<li>We were still in the middle of the pandemic and only just getting access to vaccines.</li>
									<li>We were all were exhausted by the prospect of spending nine hours a week on Zoom after a tough year of making sacrifices to keep each other safe.</li></p>
								</ul>

									<p>My goal was to develop a class that would a) deliver an outstanding educational experience for in-person and remote students and b) rejuvenate our minds and spirits after a long and difficult year.</p>

									<b>APPROACH</b>
									<p>I designed a hybrid class that revolved around a single novel: Haruki Murakami’s <i>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle </i> (1994).</p>
									<p>Rather than building a curriculum with my usual approach - to curate a wide and diverse range of interdisciplinary sources - I decided to focus on one text to help alleviate our collective burnout. We would spend the 4 weeks exploring four major aspects of reading a novel:</p>
									<ul>
									<li>reading and analyzing the novel itself</li>
									<li>learning about the author (and authorship in general) and understanding the novel in the context of the author’s work as a whole</li>
									<li>understanding one’s role as a reader of novels and developing insights on reading audiences and communities</li>
									<li>appreciating that text in its cultural, social, historical, national, and/or global context.</li>
								</ul>

									<p>Each week we focused on one component so that by the end of the class, students understood how to appreciate the novel through this multifaceted approach. I also curated a list of secondary resources to give students a comprehensive guide to each aspect of the novel - the text, the author, the reader, the world.</p>

									<p>I selected the novel by considering the following factors:</p>
									<ul>
									<li>The text in question had to be long enough to sustain us over four weeks (36 hours of class time).</li>
									<li>But it also had to be engaging enough to read rather quickly so that students could finish the novel within the 4 week period and still have time to a) engage with secondary resources b) complete writing assignments to deepen their understanding of the novel.</li>
									<li>I wanted something modern (my area of expertise is 20th and 21st century literature) but not too recent - something that had existing secondary research and preferably a text with a relatively well known author.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>I put out a call on social media, checked out a ton of books from the library, and after considering all the options (some of which included Elena Ferrante’s <i>My Brilliant Friend</i>, Vikram Seth’s <i>A Suitable Boy</i>, Bernardine Evaristo’s <i>Girl, Woman, Other</i>, and Richard Powers’ <i>The Overstory</i>), I landed on Haruki Murakami’s <i>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</i> - a novel with a rich national and historical context, of significant global repute, and authored by someone who enjoys an enormous worldwide fandom.</p>

									<b>SETTING</b>
									<p>I reserved an outdoor classroom to prioritize a safe meeting space. Since this setup lacked AV support, I asked everyone to bring a device with Zoom on it to make the in-person meetings accessible to my remote students. We also used online annotation tools (MS Note and Jamboard) to document our conversations and enable backchanneling. We met in the outdoor classroom twice a week and remotely on Zoom once a week.</p>

									<p>I also opened up this class to a select group of people from all around the world after several friends and colleagues expressed interest in the course concept. These folks were invited to read the novel during the same 4 week period as my class. I set up a Goodreads forum so that this group could chat about the novel (my students had a separate discussion board on our institutional LMS). Some of my colleagues visited my class (both in-person and via Zoom) and I received permission from the readers outside of our campus community to share some of their reactions to the novel with my students.</p>

									<b>OUTCOMES</b>
									<ul>
										<li>The students developed fresh insights on their reading habits. Rather than learning exclusively about the text, they engaged in a self-reflexive study of their own practices.</li>
										<li>They appreciated the streamlined structure of the class and the relative simplicity of having only one text to read (though with access to plenty of secondary resources).</li>
										<li>Both my students and the readers I invited to read along with us enjoyed the sense of community that was built from this class. My students got a glimpse at what reading practices might look like after college and my friends were able to participate in a robust reading community, given the rarity of such communities outside of educational settings and book clubs.</li>

						<article id="virtuallearning">
								<h2 class="major">Virtual learning</h2>
									<b>CONTEXT</b>
									<p>Like educators everywhere, I briefly descended into panic when we had to shift to virtual education in March 2020, but then quickly shifted my mindset and took the opportunity to learn new skills in order to deliver an outstanding educational experience remotely. I am forever grateful to the incredible <a href="https://my.wlu.edu/carpe-(harte-center)/faculty-and-staff/profile?ID=x25098">Paul Hanstedt</a> for leading emergency faculty workshops as soon as we received stay at home orders. He and the experts whose skills he solicited helped us pivot online seamlessly. </p>
									<b>APPROACH</b>
									<p>After some trial and error during the winter and spring terms of 2020, I adopted a strategy that I would use for my fall 2020 and winter 2021 classes, which all met Mon/Wed/Fri:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Each Monday, my students watched a short (~10-20 minute) prerecorded lecture video on the week’s topic. I kept the lectures short on the recommendation of <a href="http://up.csail.mit.edu/other-pubs/las2014-pguo-engagement.pdf">trusted pedagogical research</a>.</li>
										<li>The videos were accompanied with an assignment - depending on the week, students were asked to: record a video of themselves on Flipgrid in response to a specific prompt, write a 250-500 word post on our LMS discussion forum, or come to Wednesday’s meeting with prepared responses to a specific question.</li>
										<li>Each Wednesday we had a remote meeting on Zoom to have a structured conversation and activity about our topic and text of the week.</li>
										<li>On Fridays, I held one-on-one meetings with students over Zoom so that I could get to know them better and so that they could spend more time on the topic of the week if they wanted. These were not required, but I asked each student to sign up for at least one session with me. Some students showed up on a weekly basis.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Meeting once a week felt antithetical to the spirit of a small liberal arts college, which boasts small faculty-to-student ratios and prizes close contact between one another. But it was a setup that I thought best fit the challenging circumstances we were all in. My priority was to carefully balance an exceptional learning experience with our collective mental health.</p>

									<b>OUTCOMES</b>
									<ul>
									<li>My strategy was successful: students overwhelmingly loved the setup of the class and expressed appreciation for its flexibility.</li>
									<li>We built a solid learning community remotely - evident in the fact that students felt comfortable having tough conversations about issues ranging from race and racism to immigration and citizenship.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Here are a few classes that were 100% remote (during fall 2020 and winter 2021): <a href="https://github.com/nkharput/nkharput.github.io/blob/10c00186a173bef98f5b8906394e82e9bc29710e/Syllabi/Malcolm%20X%20Winter%2021%20syllabus.pdf">Malcolm X</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nkharput/nkharput.github.io/blob/10c00186a173bef98f5b8906394e82e9bc29710e/Syllabi/Animal%20Intimacies%20Winter%202021%20syllabus.pdf">Animal Intimacies</a></p>

						<article id="contentstrategy">
								<h2 class="major">Content strategy</h2>
									<b>CONTEXT</b>
									<p>My strategy for building content for my classes is driven by a desire to approach important social and civic issues through a rich variety of texts.</p>
									<p>For example, whether I teach a course on Asian American literature or an Ethnic Studies course on citizenship or social movements, I often teach a module on the history of Japanese American incarceration in the U.S. during the second World War.</p>
									<p>I want students to understand the historical details of this dark period of time, but I also want them to empathize with the individuals at the center of these histories. I employ a people- and narrative-centric approach in order to present the impact of the events. I also want students to understand the longevity of these events and to understand how today’s world is shaped by the past.</p>

									<b>APPROACH</b>
									<br>To forge a deep connection between my students and the topic of Japanese American incarceration:
									<ul>
									<li>I deliver a short lecture on the details of Executive Order 9066 and the forced relocation of Japanese Americans into concentration camps, with a focus on terminology (i.e., I explain why I use “concentration camps” and “incarceration” instead of “internment camps” and “internment”) to accompany the assigned texts.</li>
									<li>I often assign the following texts:</li>
									<ul>
					
					<li><b>Yuri Kochiyama, “Then Came the War”</b>
					  <br>A text by the famous activist describing period of time in which she and her family were detained in a concentration camp in Jerome, Arkansas. I also include a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApXSv6845cU">video</a> of the actress Sandra Oh reading the letter in order to bring Kochiyama’s words to life.</li>
					
					<li><b><a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/radiolab-presents-more-perfect-american-pendulum-i">An episode of More Perfect</a></b>
					  <br>A podcast from the creators of Radiolab, this episode features the story of the civil rights activist Fred Korematsu. It’s a striking episode because it begins with the story of Karen Korematsu finding out in school that the Korematsu involved in the 1944 Supreme Court case was none other than her father. He had never revealed the truth about his past to his own daughter.</li>
					<li><b>John Okada’s No-No Boy</b>
					  <br>A novel (published only 12 years after the end of WW2) that received deeply negative responses from Japanese American readers who felt that this novel portrayed them poorly, which to them was irresponsible given their efforts to recover after the war. Though troubling in some respects, the novel offers a cutting portrait of several Japanese American characters who are negotiating what it means to be American after the war.</li>
					<li><b>Hisaye Yamamoto, “Wilshire Bus”</b>
					 <br>A short story that takes place on a bus traveling through Los Angeles. The narrator recounts a disturbing scene of anti-Asian hatred against her fellow passengers on the bus but ultimately does nothing. The story offers a telling look at interracial solidarity (or lack thereof) and bystander politics.</li>
						</ul>		

								<b>OUTCOMES</b>
								<ul>
									<li>The diverse collection of texts that I assign encourages students to connect to the subject matter on multiple levels: historical, political, literary, and emotional.</li>
									<li>Students learn about aspects of U.S. history that they don’t often encounter in their education. Even in California, a very small number of my students were exposed to an exhaustive account of forced relocation and concentration camps.</li>
									<li>Students draw connections between past and present events. They often share <b><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/11/18/george-takei-they-interned-my-family-dont-let-them-do-it-to-muslims/">George Takei’s work</a></b>, as the actor and activist often draws from his experience of incarceration to speak out against Islamophobia.</li>

							<article id="research">
								<h2 class="major">Research projects</h2>
								<p>I’m a qualitative researcher and humanist. My work is informed by a desire to understand equity in creative landscapes. I study the obstacles that are faced by underrepresented writers, artists, and cultural creators. Who gets to make art and what social, political, and cultural forces determine those outcomes?
								<p>More specifically, I address these questions through a study of American literature and culture from the 20th and 21st centuries. I work primarily with contemporary Muslim American texts, which offer a fascinating look at the intersection of art, culture, and politics. Muslim American storytellers are navigating a world that is informed by a host of different forces (such as Islamophobia, racism, citizenship and immigration restrictions, war, political instability), which means that the art they make is shaped by those forces.
								<p>In my ongoing research project, I investigate the links between race, representation, and responsibility in the work of contemporary Muslim American writing and media. My research is informed by some of the following questions:
								<ul>
								<li>How do underrepresented storytellers navigate the social, cultural, and political landscapes that they’re working in?</li>
								<li>What expectations or responsibilities are placed on underrepresented storytellers once they gain a platform?</li>
								<li>How do storytellers react to those expectations and what tactics do they deploy in order to affirm or reject the burden of responsibility?</li>
								<li>What kinds of relationships are formed between storytellers and their audiences given these expectations?</li>
								<li>What conflicts arise between the storyteller’s freedom of expression and the values of the audience community?</li>
								</ul>
								</p>

								<p><b>METHODS</b>
								<br>
								I did my doctoral training in a Literature department that emphasized interdisciplinary approaches, which means that the objects of my research include literary sources as well as popular media (television shows, movies, podcasts, and music). Some of the texts that I work with in my current research activities include:
								<ul>
									<li><a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/ayad-akhtar">Ayad Akhtar's <i>Disgraced</i></a></li>
									<li><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/704249/the-reluctant-fundamentalist-by-mohsin-hamid/">Mohsin Hamid's <i>The Reluctant Fundamentalist</i></a></li>
									<li><a href="https://www.fatimahasghar.com/if-they-come-for-us">Fatima Asghar's <i>If They Come For Us</i></a></li>
									<li><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80049714">Aziz Ansari's <i>Master of None</i> (Netflix)</a></li>
									<li><a href="https://www.hulu.com/series/ramy-4bcb6c3a-3d9a-4d49-b8e0-57fb7de9c8d6">Ramy Youssef's <i>Ramy</i> (Hulu)</a></li>
								</ul>
								<p> I rely on the following qualitative research methods to understand this body of literature and media:
								<br>
								<br>primary research | secondary research | textual and content analysis | data collection and organization | site visits (to museums, libraries, community centers, playhouses) | interviews.
								</p>
	

								<p><b>OUTCOMES</b>
								<br>
								My findings are disseminated in a range of outlets: journal articles, book chapters, encyclopedias, public talks, and conference presentations. You can find a list of my publications and presentations <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A7iZtZLxc5A9NqnqB0ovv6msZwhv1pg5z0f_zcIH4FA/edit?usp=sharing"><b>here</b></a>. My most recent research project is a book (tentatively titled <i>The Burden of Humanization: Race, Representation, and Responsibility in Muslim American Culture</i>) that I am currently writing.

						<!-- Listening projects -->
							<article id="listen">
								<h2 class="major">Listening projects</h2>
						
								<p>The practice of listening is at the core of my personal and professional life. Listening is simultaneously one our most underdeveloped practices and one of the most essential skills needed to become a better critical thinker, a more effective communicator, and an equitable researcher.</p>

								<p>Two of my courses used listening and sound as major components in order to challenge my students’ listening skills:</p>
								<p><b>Listening to the World</b>, an Ethnic Studies seminar [<a href="https://github.com/nkharput/nkharput.github.io/blob/840e599882bfc4231e0ce4e30f231641155617a3/Syllabi/Listening%20to%20the%20World%20syllabus.pdf">syllabus</a>]. <br>This was the very first course that I designed after getting my PhD. I wanted to present an interdisciplinary approach to listening so that students could learn how sound can be political, racial, and gendered. We listened to music, protest chants, political speeches, and podcasts, and we read secondary research (in sound studies and other disciplines) to deepen our understanding of sound. Students documented their listening practices over time by maintaining a weekly listening journal. They also delivered presentations to connect what they were learning in class to a current issue concerning sound. Together, we built an intellectually challenging learning community that completely shifted our understanding about sound and listening.</p>
								<p><b>Organic Social Movements</b>, an Ethnic Studies lecture class [<a href="https://github.com/nkharput/nkharput.github.io/blob/10c00186a173bef98f5b8906394e82e9bc29710e/Syllabi/Organic%20Social%20Movements%20syllabus.pdf">syllabus</a>]
								<br>A survey course on various social and political movements in the U.S. For their final projects, the students had to curate a music playlist on Spotify to research and analylze a specific social movement. The results were immensely creative; students researched everything from LGBTQ activists of color, body positivity movements, student activism in the U.S., native Hawaiian storytellers and activists, queer allyship with the British Miners' Strike (1984-1985,) and many other rich expressions of social protest. The students connected what they learned about social and political movements to a vast range of musical expressions.</p>
								<p>I also use music and podcasts regularly in my pedagogy in order to give students the opportunity to appreciate a specific subject matter from different angles. More on this coming soon.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Public projects</h2>
								<p>While most of my work so far has been in higher ed, I’ve also been involved with public-facing work throughout my career.</p>

								<p>Museums play a significant role in my research. As a graduate student, I made site visits to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Arab American National Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Institut du Monde Arabe, and many other museums and community centers in an effort to understand how museums engage with current political discourses in their representation practices.</p>

								<p>My research and travels eventually led to a collaboration with the <a href="https://arabamericanmuseum.org/">Arab American National Museum</a>. In 2016, I was asked to serve as research consultant for their ongoing efforts to update their permanent galleries with developing insights on changing immigrant demographics in key U.S. cities.
								<br> In 2021, I served as a judge for their annual <a href="https://arabamericanmuseum.org/book-awards/"> book awards</a>. My fellow judges and I picked <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/stories-my-father-told-me-memories-of-a-childhood-in-syria-and-lebanon/9781951082659">this remarkable book</a> as one of the winners in the nonfiction category. .</p>

								<p>Several of my classes have public-facing aspects - e.g., the <a href="#readingpractices">reading practices course</a> I taught in 2021.<p>

								<p>I recently started freelance writing for the <a href="https://myaapp.org/news-and-stories/what-kazuo-ishiguro-and-his-artificial-friends-teach-us-about-human-animal-relationships/">American Association for Pet Parents</a>. More content is coming soon.</p>

								<p>I’ve also done some writing for <a href="https://asianamlitfans.dreamwidth.org/">Asian American Literary Fans,</a> a blog that has been inspiring readers to discover Asian American literary fiction since 2007. It’s run by one of the foremost experts on Asian American literature, <a href="https://www.fordham.edu/homepage/7200/stephen_hong_sohn">Stephen Hong Sohn</a>.</p>
